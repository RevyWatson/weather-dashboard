# Weather Dashboard
Weather application provides accurate weather information for the chosen location utilizing the API [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve the data for a given city and client-side local storage. This application uses dynamic HTML, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework, and is powered by JavaSctipt.

## Acceptance Criteria
* When user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* When user views current weather conditions for that city they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
* When user views the UV index they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
* When the user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
* When the user clicks on a city in the search history they are presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## Future Developement
The above acceptance critria was not met. This application currently isn't functional. Initially it was fetching data from the API and logging it in the console. As soon as the page went live it began to log errors in the console instead of displaying the fetched data. After trying to debug this issue for a few hours, it began to load to a 405 page after pushing the search button. I didn't have time to correct this. In the near future I would like to correct these errors and complete the project.
